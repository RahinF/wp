        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
        <div>In the past I have played around with ruby and learned a bit of html, css and javascript in my free time, however I didn't have any goals or motivation at the time so I didn't get very far as a result I know just the basics.</div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div>I want to say both but lean more towards a designer. </div>

        <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
        <div>I want to learn how to program to get a job.</div>

        <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
        <div>Programming knowledge, information on what the current standards are in the real world and how to get there myself.</div>

        <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
        <div>I know a bit about design. I am constantly trying to improve myself and am open to other peoples ideas. I am always willing to take on more work than necessary as it allows me to learn more. The strengths I would like my partner to have is probably more experience in programming since I don't have much myself and leadership skills, I'm very
          indecisive and I lack confidence in decisions that I make.</div>

        <div>What websites do you use the most?</div>
        <div>Youtube and Crunchyroll.</div>

        <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
        <div>I like to collect and play trading card games, build gundam model kits and draw (I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I am constantly fixing my work and rarely finish anything).</div>
